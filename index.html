        <p class="lead mb-4">Many of my greatest qualities have come from what I have learned from being very involved in high school. I wanted to do my very best at everything and every task I was given. I tried to do as many clubs and take as many courses as possible such as AP classes and ASB as well as becoming a manager for our boyâ€™s basketball team. All of this taught me how to manage my time and stress because as you can imagine, I was very packed with work every day. I took six AP classes throughout my high school career that has taught me how to study and be prepared for every question that can be thrown at me. ASB is our Associated Student Body class that I was very eager to be a part of. I worked my way to become one of the chair members for leading our yearbook team. I became a teacher to thirteen students as well as trained one of the teachers to take over after I graduate. Being a part of the yearbook team, I had many tasks such as organizing the templates of each page, staying connected with the publishing company, keeping my team in order by reaching all deadlines, and also organizing days and times to take photos of people. I taught my team how to use the Canon cameras and all the lenses and equipment that come along with the camera such as a tripod, lens protectors, and SD cards. Always wanting the best for my team, I also advocated and proposed the idea of getting a new camera at the formal ASB meetings we had every month and succeeded. I made many signup sheets for my team to make sure the equipment was checked out safely and returned in the same matter it was originally taken out. When it was time for events, I made sure people knew it was their duty to attend the event and make sure to take appropriate photos of students to include in the yearbook page for that event. When it was time for class superlatives votes and elections, I was there with my camera capturing every person that had won. All of this taught me many skills such as time management, communication, connecting with a group, collaboration, leadership, and responsibility. I will be able to apply these skills to this job by collaborating with others and being able to take responsibility and become a leader, however, I do understand the importance of being a follower and will not overstep. When my teacher later proposed to me the idea of becoming our boyâ€™s basketball teamâ€™s manager I was hesitant to join since I was already pinched for time, however, I also realized the importance of learning to manage a large group of people. After deciding to join the boyâ€™s basketball team to be their manager, I was instantly met with seniors night where the manager had to create a special poster and snacks for each senior player in which I delegated the work evenly among other managers. This role taught me how to delegate work evenly among people all around me to be able to get a task done on time. <br><br>

        
Later in my high school career, I also got in contact with American Red Cross and coordinated a blood drive at my school. I attended board meetings and proposed this idea and raised money for the event. My tasks included assigning shifts to other ASB volunteers that had a signup sheet during our lunchtime. I also created and formatted the signup sheet to be convenient and quick for students to fill out but also get all the required information that I needed to sign each student up properly. After this, I created uniform time intervals in which each academyâ€™s students had their own time that they were expected to go and donate blood. I had to learn how to use the American Red Cross website and then teach my group all that I have learned in order to begin delegate work to each student. As the day of the blood drive came, I would arrive at school hours earlier in order to create arrow signs to lead students and any of the people from the community to the correct location in which the blood drive was being held. I would also help the nurses and the head nurse set up all the equipment as well as set up the station in which I would stay in order to keep track of students as they arrived for their appointment or straggling students that decided to do a walk-in. I was also trained in how to care for each student after they have donated blood and the correct procedure in which each student must go through in order to be released back to class. I made sure each student drinks their choice of water, orange juice, or cranberry juice, and also had their choice of the snacks that I had gotten to help get sugar back into their systems. Throughout my four years at high school, I coordinated this blood drive for the American Red Cross Foundations eight times. And each year I began to incorporate new methods and new sign-up sheets to help get as many sign-ups from students, staff, or people from my community as possible. As well as try to create an enjoyable experience for all the nurses that worked and make sure everything runs smoothly and all students leave healthy and return to class safely. All of these tasks have taught me so many skills that I will incorporate into my job and work ethic if I am given the opportunity to become a part of this company. I will continue to strive and learn all that I can in order to not only improve myself as a person but also improve this company.

        I am currently studying Biology at the University of California, Riverside. I chose Biology because I was very interested in the subject after having a physiology and anatomy class in high school. I fell in love with the way the human body functions and how it constantly working to keep us alive whether we are conscious of the process or not. It fascinated me that my own body was capable of so many different factions every time. Knowing this would be a part of my life, I began doing my own research in the field and learning more about what I can do with this degree. When applying to colleges, I started choosing schools that offer Biology as a major. As a student, I have taken Biology 005A which is the introduction to cellular and molecular biology. I then took Biology 005B which is the introduction to organismal biology where we did research in the laboratory section. We also learned the evolution of animals to humans and the evolution of plants. We also learned to categories each species into each phylogeny. I am currently enrolled in Biology 005C which is the introduction to evolution and ecology. We are also in the middle of a research assignment that requires us to work in groups and present our findings. My group and I have chosen to research if the weather has any effect on the number of COVID- 19 cases in Manassa County Virginia and in Orange County California. We chose these places because they are close in population and have similar weather conditions. Through this lab, we are going to be learning h=gow to use programs such as JMP, ANOVA, and Net Logo. This means that I will be qualified and able to run these programs and will be able to recreate these for any other experiment. I have also taken General Chemistry 001A - 001C each with its own laboratory section where I also learned to use all the equipment needed, such as weighing scales, graduated cylinder, pipet, volumetric pipet, bunsen burner, Erlenmeyer flask, volumetric flask, test tubes, burette, and prober safety equipment or wardrobe safety. I have now already taken general Physics courses as well. I have taken Physics 002A - 002B with labs. Due to the pandemic and the health and safety regulations have stopped me from having the lab section in person so I have been doing simulations and my own experiment at my own house. Doing this has helped improve my understanding of physics as a whole because it allows me to visually see the material I am learning. I have a basic knowledge of how most general chemistry and general physics with a great knowledge of biology and the evolution of our environment. I have also taken other courses such as world history, psychology, computer science, economics, and English. All of these courses contribute to my qualifications to be the greatest biologist for your company. I will be continuing my education and taking more upper-division courses as I will be employed at your company. I will also require days off for my exams and finals as they are required of me to give them my full attention. I would also appreciate the opportunity to work with your company and preforming research or contributing to your companyâ€™s research.
